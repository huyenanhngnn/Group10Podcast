              <br><br> 
                  Today, we're discussing the sonic marketing strategies of two major retail players in Vietnam: Circle K and Winmart. Winmart is the Vietnam's largest supermarket chain that dominates the domestic retail market. Circle K, originally from the U.S., is currently one of the most widely recognized convenience store brands with 450 stores across Vietnam. <br><br>
                  To prepare for this episode, we visited 5 Circle K stores and 5 Winmart supermarkets to gain the most helpful insights for you. So we hope you will enjoy it^^ <br><br>

            <p style="font-family: Inter">Host: “Welcome to the Conscious Consumer podcast, where we explore sensory marketing in retail to help every consumer become more conscious of their buying decisions.
              Today, we're discussing the fascinating sonic marketing strategies of two major retail players in Vietnam: Circle K and Winmart. How do these stores use sound to influence your shopping experience? Let's dive in. <br><br>
              
              First, let's talk about audio branding and how these retailers can use sound to strengthen their brand identity. So, Everytime you walk in Circle K, you will be greeted by: <br><br>
              
              Soundbite: Fun Vietnamese music, the door sound and a friendly “Circle K xin chao!” <br> <br>
              
              This consistent audio branding sets a welcoming vibe and creates a uniform hospitality experience. Not only that, as Circle K targets a younger demographic, mainly highschool or college students, it fills its space with the latest American hits, creating an upbeat, energetic atmosphere. The employees told us that the overhead music are shuffled from the company’s curated playlist, making it consistent across hundred of stores. <br> <br>
              
              In contrast, Winmart caters to a broader and older segment including housewives, families, office workers. And their music selection?” <br><br>
              
              Soundbite: Winmart music <br><br>

              It's a mixed bag of Vietnamese, Korean, or US UK songs, varying significantly from store to store, which might confuse rather than comfort. Let’s ask Linh - a frequent customer in both places on her shopping experience. <br><br>
              
              "Actually, I don’t really care much about the overhead music in Winmart and Circle K. But I do notice that Winmart’s music is kind of annoying because speakers in a store can play vastly different random music. It makes me want to get out of it as soon as possible. But Circle K is different. they have good music selections, mostly US/UK songs that matches my taste, so I can stay there chilling and talking with friends for hours.” <br> <br>
              
              This brings us to the second topic: How important is relevant audio to the customer journey? According to a study by Rebecca et al. in 2019, providing irrelevant sounds, visuals, and smells decreased participants' enjoyment of the product. If the sounds don’t fit the store, people might not enjoy their shopping as much. But if the music and smells are just right, they can make people feel good and have a better time.
              
              For a big retail store like Winmart, playing different music in each part of the store can make the shopping experience more enjoyable. Although their overhead music can be generic and sometimes confusing as mentioned, in specific areas like the wine section, you might hear classical music [sound], while the ready-to-eat section sizzles with the sound of cooking [sound], and the babbling sound of water in the Seafood area [sound]. <br> <br>
              
              And it's not just about the type of audio, but its direction. Both Circle K and Winmart use sound to subtly guide shoppers' movements. Imagine hearing the crackle of fresh produce or the sizzle from the deli section; these sounds can draw you towards certain products, encouraging exploration and, ultimately, purchases. Especially for Winmart, directional audios from display signages subconsciously guide shoppers to the perishable foods area, which is clever as it helps ensure that items with short shelf life are sold quickly. <br> <br>
              
              So, what's the takeaway for our retailers? We think that Circle K is doing quite well with their audio strategies; however, they can consider adding more Vietnamese hits to create more fun and sense of familiarity for the young consumers. And For Winmart, the lack of a consistent sonic branding might be a missed opportunity. Integrating a more cohesive audio strategy could enhance the shopping experience significantly, and potentially boosting customer satisfaction (Gustafsson, 2015). <br> <br>
              
              As we wrap up today's episode, remember, the next time you're walking the aisles of your local Circle K or Winmart, pay attention to the sounds around you. They're not just background noise; they're parts of a sensory marketing strategy designed to influence your shopping behavior. Stay conscious, and see you next time.”
